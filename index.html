        <h3>Team I07 with Progate.</h3>

        <p> Have you ever worked in collaboration with another lab?
          Or been involved in an international research program?If so, you might have realized that it’s usually not a big problem to use the same kits and reagents in many labs around the world.
          This might not sound so special but when you think of industry, the supply chains created there are quite impressive.
          In industry, nearly all companies rely heavily on cross-departmental collaboration.
          Cross-departmental collaboration allows them to provide exceptional customer service, become more efficient, and build trust in the organization.</p>

             <p class="text-contents">In an ideal world, your product would work perfectly all the time.
              But we are not living in a perfect world and perfect product performance rarely happens in reality.
              Products fail to perform or break down completely.. </p>

             <p>The supply chain management department</p>
            <p class="text-contents">upply chain management is all about the flow of goods and services.

            From raw materials, to delivering the finished goods from the production site to the point of consumption, this involves a very efficient and effective electronic system.</p>

            <p>The production and quality assurance departments</p>
            <p class="text-contents">The production department turns raw material or other inputs into final products following a series of processes.

            This involves the purchasing of the raw materials and effective planning of a long line of production processes.

            These production processes need to be monitored to make sure every product is produced correctly — including the correct amount of the product, the correct quality standards of the product, and so on.</p>

            <p>The finance department</p>
            <p class="text-contents">As a PhD, this department may have made you cringe in the past.

            Balancing budgets in academia is normally equated to begging for grant funding.

            Fortunately, in industry, financial experts within a dedicated finance department focus exclusively on the fiscal aspects of running a company.</p>
